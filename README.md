 In the era of rapid technological advancement, traditional shopping methods are evolv
ing into seamless and efficient processes. This project focuses on an Automated Billing
 System equipped with an RFID scanner and an automatic billing system to enhance
 the shopping experience. Key features include RFID scanning and automated billing,
 designed to provide convenience, efficiency, and heightened customer satisfaction. Super
markets utilize shopping trolleys to help customers select and store products they intend
 to purchase. However, the traditional method of placing items into the cart and then
 proceeding to a checkout counter for billing is highly time-consuming. Our Automated
 Billing System aims to streamline this process, reducing wait times and improving overall
